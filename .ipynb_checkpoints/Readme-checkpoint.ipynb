    "\n",
    "The following are the tools that are covered in the notebooks. They are popular tools that machine learning engineers and data scientists need in one way or another an day to day. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python** is a high level programming language that has got a lot of popularity in the data community and with the rapid growth of the libraries and frameworks, this is a right programming language to do ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NumPy** is a scientific computing tool used for array or matrix operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pandas** is a great and simple tool for analyzing and manipulating data from a variety of different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Matplotlib** is a visualization tool that will help us to make sense of datasets by making plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Seaborn** is another data visualization tool built on top of Matplotlib which is pretty simple to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scikit-Learn**: Instead of building machine learning models from scratch, Scikit-Learn makes it easy to use classical models in a few lines of code. This tool is adapted by almost the whole of the ML community and industries, from the startups to the big techs. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **TensorFlow and Keras** for neural networks: TensorFlow is a popular deep learning framework used for building models suitable for different fields such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. At its backend, it uses Keras which is a high level API for building neural networks easily. TensorFlow has gained a lot of popularity in the ML community due to its complete ecosystem made of wholesome tools including TensorBoard, TF Datasets, TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow Extended, TensorFlow.js, etc...\n",
