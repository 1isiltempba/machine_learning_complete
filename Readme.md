# A Complete Machine Learning Package


***Techniques, tools, best practices and everything you need to build effective Machine Learning Systems!***


This is a comprehensive repository containing 30+ notebooks on Python programming, data manipulation, data analysis, data visualization, data cleaning, classical machine learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing(NLP). 

As much as I can, I tried to care much about things that can be useful to anyone who is looking an intensive machine learning resource, either for learning or solving real problems. Everything is explained, and further resources are provided in some cases. 

You can view or run the notebooks with

* Blender
* DeepNotes
* Colab
* Github Notebooks


## Tools Overview

The following are the tools that are covered in the notebooks. They are popular tools that machine learning engineers and data scientists need in one way or another an day to day. 

* **Python** is a high level programming language that has got a lot of popularity in the data community and with the rapid growth of the libraries and frameworks, this is a right programming language to do ML.

* **NumPy** is a scientific computing tool used for array or matrix operations. 

* **Pandas** is a great and simple tool for analyzing and manipulating data from a variety of different sources.

* **Matplotlib** is a visualization tool that will help us to make sense of datasets by making plots.

* **Seaborn** is another data visualization tool built on top of Matplotlib which is pretty simple to use.

* **Scikit-Learn**: Instead of building machine learning models from scratch, Scikit-Learn makes it easy to use classical models in a few lines of code. This tool is adapted by almost the whole of the ML community and industries, from the startups to the big techs. 

* **TensorFlow and Keras** for neural networks: TensorFlow is a popular deep learning framework used for building models suitable for different fields such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. At its backend, it uses Keras which is a high level API for building neural networks easily. TensorFlow has gained a lot of popularity in the ML community due to its complete ecosystem made of wholesome tools including TensorBoard, TF Datasets, TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow Extended, TensorFlow.js, etc...

## Used Datasets

Many of the datasets used for this repository are from the following sources: 

* [UC OpenML](https://www.openml.org)
* [Seaborn Datasets](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data)
* [Scikit-Learn datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html)
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* [TensorFlow datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview)

As much as I can, I used unfamiliar datasets wherever possible, especially if I were not motivated enough for the day.

## Running The Code

To run the codes, you need to install the above tools into your machine. It is advised to create a virtual environment. 

If you don't want to install anything, you can run all notebooks in Google Colab, or view the notebooks interactively through Brender. You can also run them in DeepNote. 

## Sponsoring the Project

I would appreciate very much if you can show me some love by sponsoring this work. I initially started it with the idea of having all things anyone might need in one repository, and I am so amazed by how far this has got. 

You can sponsor me through Patreon or here. Or buy him a coffee.
