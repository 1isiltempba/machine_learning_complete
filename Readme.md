# A Complete Machine Learning Package


***Techniques, tools, best practices and everything you need to to learn machine learning!***


This is a comprehensive repository containing 30+ notebooks on Python programming, data manipulation, data analysis, data visualization, data cleaning, classical machine learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing(NLP). 

All notebooks were created with the readers in mind. Every notebook starts with a high-level overview of any specific algorithm/concepts being covered. Wherever possible, visuals are used to make things clear. 


## Viewing and Running the Notebooks

The easiest way to view all the notebooks is to use Nbviewer. If you want to play with the codes, you can use the following platforms: 

* DeepNotes
* Colab
* Kaggle
* My Binder


## Tools Overview

The following are the tools that are covered in the notebooks. They are popular tools that machine learning engineers and data scientists need in one way or another an day to day. 

* **Python** is a high level programming language that has got a lot of popularity in the data community and with the rapid growth of the libraries and frameworks, this is a right programming language to do ML.

* **NumPy** is a scientific computing tool used for array or matrix operations. 

* **Pandas** is a great and simple tool for analyzing and manipulating data from a variety of different sources.

* **Matplotlib** is a visualization tool that will help us to make sense of datasets by making plots.

* **Seaborn** is another data visualization tool built on top of Matplotlib which is pretty simple to use.

* **Scikit-Learn**: Instead of building machine learning models from scratch, Scikit-Learn makes it easy to use classical models in a few lines of code. This tool is adapted by almost the whole of the ML community and industries, from the startups to the big techs. 

* **TensorFlow and Keras** for neural networks: TensorFlow is a popular deep learning framework used for building models suitable for different fields such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. At its backend, it uses Keras which is a high level API for building neural networks easily. TensorFlow has gained a lot of popularity in the ML community due to its complete ecosystem made of wholesome tools including TensorBoard, TF Datasets, TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow Extended, TensorFlow.js, etc...
